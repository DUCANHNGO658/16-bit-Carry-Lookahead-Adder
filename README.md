# 16-bit-Carry-Lookahead-Adder
The sixth study project focuses on designing a 16-bit Carry Lookahead Adder (CLA).
Although the CLA has a more complex architecture than the Ripple Carry Adder, it significantly reduces carry propagation delay by computing carries in parallel using generate and propagate logic.<img width="1572" height="574" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-04 144715" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1f5c5919-a50d-4542-9068-807a6dea97d1" />
